Given the same starting and ending block as the previous test (hint hint), 
return the fare for the customer. The first four hundred feet are free. 
For a distance between 400 and 2000 feet, the price is 2 cents per foot 
(not including 400, which are free!). Then Scuber charges a flat fare for a distance over 
2000 feet and under 2500 feet. Finally, Scuber does not allow any rides over 2500 feet â€” the 
function returns 'cannot travel that far' if a ride over 2500 feet is requested.
